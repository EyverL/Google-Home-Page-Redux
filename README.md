Google Home Page Redux

I recreated the Google homepage using HTML and CSS as a way to practice
and maintain my HTML and CSS basic and essential skills knowledge.

The reason for the use of blue instead of the default white background is because
I actually have my Google Chrome home page set to that color and I like it, so 
I just copied it that way.
